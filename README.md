This study investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for improving data quality control at VTB Bank. Following a comprehensive literature review and market analysis, a machine learning model tailored to VTB's specific needs is developed.

Isolation Forest is identified as the most efficient ML model for anomaly detection in VTB's data, showing potential to save up to 30% of work time currently devoted to manual data profiling. The projected economic model shows promising profitability, with a positive net present value (NPV) after five years and a payback period of four years.

The research suggests that implementing ML algorithms into data quality control operations could significantly enhance efficiency and profitability at VTB. The proposed solution is recommended for implementation.

In order to obtain the evaluation results from notebooks with _modelling_ prefix, the following steps should be conducted:
1) Create the following directory in your working directory _./Datasets_
2) Download "Credit Card Customers" dataset from the following Kaggle page https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers
3) Perform preprocessing steps including execution of the following notebooks sequentially: _dataset_preparation.ipynb_, _anomaly_generation.ipynb_, _feature_generation.ipynb_.
4) Execute notebooks with _modelling_ prefix.
